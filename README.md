# MazeSolver
This project implements a maze solver that reads a maze from a file and finds a path from the left side to the right side, crossing all required columns and rows.

## Features
- Reads maze input from a specified file.
- Implements a depth-first search algorithm to find a solution.
- Displays the maze with the path marked when a solution is found.
- Prints "NO SOLUTION" if no path exists.
